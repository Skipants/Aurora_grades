This script pulls your final grades from University of Manitoba's Aurora system and displays them nicely in your shell.

To use:
1. gem install mechanize
2. ruby gradepoller.rb <student no.> <pin>

TODO:
- Allow user to select semester
- Make PIN entry use a password entry (so your PIN does not show up in your shell and/or history)
- Show a certain amount of previous semesters or all semesters
- Show GPAs
- Poll at a certain time of day (and send an e-mail if new grades?)

NOTE: Please do not spam this script... University of Manitoba only updates the grades nightly at some time between 2am - 4am. Using it multiple times during the day is unnecessary.

I do not plan on adding to this script because I have graduated and am only posting this for fun and use of other fellow U of M students or students of other universities that possibly use Aurora. Please fork and change! I will accept pull requests liberally.
